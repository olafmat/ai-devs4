Start the game with 'start' tool.
After 'start' and after each move, you will receive a result of a frequency scan. 
If you are being tracked by a missile, it will contain "detectionCode" and "frequency".
You should use them immediately in the 'neutrlize' tool.
The frequency scan results can be distorted.
You will also receive pilot hint. It will inform of any rocks in the column ahead in a sailor English.
Read the pilot hints carefully and decide which way to go to avoid rocks.
You can fly to the next column, using 'up', 'down' and 'straight' tools. 
If you crashed, restart the game with 'start' tool.
Your goal is to get to the base, which coordinates are given at the start.
